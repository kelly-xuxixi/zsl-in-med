Event Name: Cleaning an appliance

Definition: One or more people clean an appliance.

Explication: Household appliances are machines that are used for
household functions such as cleaning, cooking, or cooling the
home. Major household appliances are typically large appliances that
are often metallic, black/white/beige/stainless steel in color, and
can include: air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes dryers, drying
cabinet, freezer, refrigerator, kitchen stove, water heater, washing
machine, trash compactor, microwave ovens and induction
cookers. Non-major household appliances are typically small appliances
that perform a more specialized task, and can include: coffee makers,
toasters, stand mixers, food processors, and electric can
openers. Small devices that are held and moved with the hand while
operating them, such as hand mixers, hair dryers, or electric
toothbrushes, are not considered appliances and therefore cleaning
these items is off-topic for this event.  Cleaning an appliance
usually involves applying some kind of cleansing product to the
appliance and scrubbing by hand and/or rinsing it with water. For a
refrigerator or freezer, cleaning may also involve simply removing
unwanted/old food items from the appliance. Cleaning of any appliance
may also involve removing or disassembling some or all of the
appliance to clean some parts separately and/or get better access to
parts of the appliance to clean them. For example, the drawers and
some shelves of a refrigerator may be removed and washed separately.
