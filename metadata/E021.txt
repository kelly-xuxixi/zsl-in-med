Event Name: Attempting a bike trick

Definition: One or more people attempt to do a trick on a bicycle,
motorcycle, or other type of motorized bike. To count as a bike for
purposes of this event, the vehicle must have two wheels (excludes
unicycles, ATVs, etc.).
 
Explication: Bikes are normally ridden with a person sitting down on
seat and holding onto the handlebars and steering with their
hands. Tricks consist of difficult ways of riding the bike, such as on
one wheel, steering with feet or standing on the seat; or intentional
motions made with the bike that are not simply slowing down/stopping
the bike, propelling it forward, or steering the bike as it
moves. Steering around obstacles or steering a bike off of a jump and
landing on the ground are generally not considered tricks in and of
themselves, however if the bike jump is set up so that the person is
jumping over something, (e.g. jumping over people or vehicles or over
a river), or if the person does a flip or other trick in the air, that
would be considered a trick.
