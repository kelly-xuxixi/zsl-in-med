Event Name: Rock climbing

Definition: One or more people climb up or across rock formations or
artificial rock walls.

Explication: Rock climbing is a physically intense activity, where the
goal is to reach the top or endpoint of a pre-defined route on a rock
formation or artificial rock wall by finding a grip on the surface
using hands and feet, and then pulling up using their arm and leg
strength. Climbers usually wear harnesses connected to ropes that will
catch them if they fall and allow them to more easily climb back down
the rock. Though climbers move quickly up/across the rock on some
climbs or portions of climbs, many climbs proceed slowly, and most of
the climber's time is spent holding themselves in position on the side
of the rock with what may be very minimal hand and footholds, and
searching with one hand or foot for the next hand or foothold that
will propel them further towards their goal destination.
